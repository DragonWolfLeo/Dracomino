# Dracomino
Dracomino is a falling block puzzle game adapted into a randomizer using [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg). 
Arrange shapes into full lines to clear them and gain items, and place shapes onto coins to collect them and 
gain more items. Dracomino features 29 different shapes, including monominos, dominos, trominos, tetrominos,
and pentominos.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Your items are shapes and abilities. The order you receive items, and even the color and orientation
remain consistent throughout multiple playthroughs. The number of pieces you have is limited, so
you'll have to collect more to reach further in a run.

## What is the goal of Dracomino?

The goal is to clear a number of lines in a single run. You can set this goal in your options.

## What are location checks in Dracomino?

Your checks are clearing lines and coins scattered throughout your board. As you clear lines, more
coins are revealed.
